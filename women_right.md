# Women rights in India 
- The principle of gender equality is enshrined in the Indian Constitution in its Preamble, Fundamental
Rights, Fundamental Duties and Directive Principles. The Constitution not only grants equality to women, but
also empowers the State to adopt measures of positive discrimination in favour of women. Within the
framework of a democratic polity, our laws, development policies, Plans and programmes have aimed at
womenâ€™s advancement in different spheres. India has also ratified various international conventions and
human rights instruments committing to secure equal rights of women. Key among them is the ratification of
the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1993.
